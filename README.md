# X-ray-Luggage-Image-Enhancement-and-Detection
Senior project by Olivia Martin, Alexandra Nussey, and Alyssa Cooper.

# STEP ONE:
Download model_weights.pth from Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B_CuD5TxBx9kpTedzKsay0MPSEzWAJ-G?usp=sharing

The training and testing folders are in the same location in case you want to create your own model (this could take about 20 minutes, so it's best to use the model we've included.)

# STEP TWO:
Look over the Object Detection Model Creation in order to understand the process.

# STEP THREE:
Run the Image Enhancement with Object Detection, changing the file paths accordingly. Use the images in the "images to test" folder
to visualize what the program is capable of.

And that's it! You should notice that the image enhancement has an impact on the object detection. While there may be some errors,
this program does a great job at detectiing pistols in luggage.
